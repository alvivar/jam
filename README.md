# jam

Tool that writes a template of an experimental approach to share functionality
between GameObjects by iterating a static list.

Experimental because it's not Object Oriented, or ECS, it's probably an anti
pattern and that scares some people.

But it's super practical and fun. Leave alone.

There is an example [here](https://github.com/alvivar/lions).
